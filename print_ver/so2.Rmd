British Columbia operates a network of air monitoring stations that
measure sulphur dioxide and other air pollutants. This indicator
reports on the concentration of sulphur dioxide from `r year_range`
and compares it to the [Canadian Ambient Air Quality
Standards](https://www.ccme.ca/en/air-quality-report#slide-7)
established by the [Canadian Council of Ministers of the
Environment](http://www.ccme.ca).

-   **Sulphur dioxide is an air pollutant.** ~~Solid or liquid
    particles floating in the air are called particulate matter. The
    smallest of these particles---those that are 2.5 microns or less in
    diameter, or less than 1/20th the width of a human hair---are called
    sulphur dioxide (SO~2~). Sulphur dioxide comes from
    many natural and human activities, including wildfires and emissions
    from prescribed burning, forestry operations, residential
    woodstoves, and transportation.^[1](#fn1)^~~
-   **Sulphur dioxide can be harmful to humans.** ~~Exposure to
    sulphur dioxide has been associated with several serious
    health effects including heart and lung disease.^[1](#fn1)^ Both
    short-term (24-hour) and longer-term (a year or more) exposure to
    sulphur dioxide can have negative effects on human health.~~
-   **Sulphur dioxide levels met the Canadian Ambient Air
    Quality Standards at `r min(print_summary$percent_achieved)`
    percent of assessed monitoring stations in B.C.** There are two standards 
    for SO~2~---an annual standard and a
    1-hour standard (see sidebar). The annual standard was met at 
    `r print_summary$n_achieved[print_summary$metric == "so2_1yr"]` of the 
    `r print_summary$n[print_summary$metric == "so2_1yr"]` stations 
    (`r print_summary$percent_achieved[print_summary$metric == "so2_1yr"]`%) 
    for which valid data was obtained, while the 1-hour standard was met at 
    `r print_summary$n_achieved[print_summary$metric == "so2_3yr"]` of the 
    `r print_summary$n[print_summary$metric == "so2_3yr"]` stations 
    (`r print_summary$percent_achieved[print_summary$metric == "so2_3yr"]`%) 
    with sufficient data for analysis.
-   **Sulphur dioxide levels met both of the Canadian Ambient
    Air Quality Standards in six of B.C.'s seven air zones.** 
    Currently, there are no 
    [air monitoring stations](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=292EC5BD62A149A192B7DD2CE155E33E)
    in the Northwest air zone.
    <!-- See the summaries calculated in the starting RMD chunk for information 
     needed to fill in the above bullet point. -->
-   **Sulphur dioxide levels are used to set management levels
    for each air zone.** Four management levels (green, yellow, orange,
    and red) are each associated with a suite of actions that become
    more rigorous as sulphur dioxide levels approach the
    Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards.

### More about the Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standard sulphur dioxide metrics:

-   There are two Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards for sulphur dioxide 
    (SO~2~). The statistical form of the SO~2~ annual
    metric is the 3-year average of the annual average concentration of
    SO~2~. The statistical form of the SO~2~ 24-hour metric is the
    3-year average of the annual 98th percentile of the daily average
    concentrations of SO~2~.
-   The SO~2~ metric for an air zone is the highest SO~2~ metric value
    reported from monitoring stations within the air zone. Air zone
    metric values are only taken from stations reporting on two years of
    data when there are no available three-year reporting stations in
    the air zone.
-   Only air monitoring stations with sufficient data on suphur dioxide
    concentrations for the `r year_range` reporting period
    were included in this indicator. Visit [Current Air Quality
    Data](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=292EC5BD62A149A192B7DD2CE155E33E)
    for a complete list of air monitoring stations across B.C.
-   ~~Data completeness and sufficiency criteria for the two SO~2~ metrics
    are described in the [Guidance Document on Achievement
    Determination: Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards for Fine
    Particulate Matter and Ozone (2012)](http://publications.gc.ca/pub?id=9.697756&sl=0).~~
    
### Canada-wide Air Quality Management System

The Air Quality Management System is Canada's approach for protecting
air quality. Under the Air Quality Management System, provinces and
territories monitor, report and manage local air quality within air
zones, with the goal of continuously improving air quality and keeping
pollutants below the Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards.

-   There are seven air zones in British Columbia: Coastal, Georgia
    Strait, Lower Fraser Valley, Southern Interior, Central Interior,
    Northeast and Northwest.
-   ~~The Air Zone Management Framework defines air zone management levels
    for sulphur dioxide based on the higher of the annual and
    1-hour sulphur dioxide levels reported from monitoring
    stations within the air zone.~~
-   The four management levels are (1) green (actions for keeping clean
    areas clean); (2) yellow (actions for preventing air quality
    deterioration); (3) orange (actions for preventing Canadian Ambient
    Air Quality Standard exceedance); and (4) red (actions for achieving
    air zone Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standard). Each management
    level is associated with a suite of actions that become more
    rigorous as sulphur dioxide levels approach the standard.
    Actions for each management level are detailed in the [Guidance Document on Air Zone Management (2019)
    (PDF)](https://ccme.ca/en/res/guidancedocumentonairzonemanagement_secured.pdf).
-   The Southern Interior, Central Interior, and Northeast air zones were 
    assigned to a yellow management level, and the Coastal, Georgia Strait and
    Lower Fraser Valley air zones were assigned to a green management level. 
    There are currently no 
    [air monitoring stations](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=292EC5BD62A149A192B7DD2CE155E33E)
    in the Northwest air zone.

#### More about the Air Quality Management System management levels:

-   ~~There can be cases when an air zone does not achieve a given
    Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standard because of sources over which
    jurisdictions have little or no control, such as those related to
    transboundary flows and exceptional events, like forest fires.~~
-   ~~Prior to determining management levels, jurisdictions have the
    option of adjusting their air zone metric values to remove such
    external influences. These arrangements aim to ensure that
    jurisdictions are responsible for managing only the emissions
    sources they can control.~~
-   ~~Wildfires are generally the largest contributor to transboundary
    flows and exceptional events in B.C. Over the `r year_range` reporting
    period, `r #tfee$n_sites` stations had one or more days during the wildfire season
    (May-October) where the daily sulphur dioxide
    concentration was determined to be influenced by smoke from
    wildfires and exceeded the 1-hour standard of 
    `r so2_lvls[["so2_3yr"]]` ppb. The
    majority of wildfire influences occurred in 2018 and 2020. Those daily
    concentrations were removed from the calculations of management
    levels, resulting in a change from red to orange for the Central Interior
    and Georgia Strait air zones; from red to yellow for the Northeast air zone.~~

### Methods

~~The methods used to develop this indicator---including procedures, data
requirements, and calculation of the Canadian Ambient Air Quality
Standard sulphur dioxide metrics---are detailed in the [Guidance
Document on Achievement Determination: Canadian Ambient Air Quality
Standards for Fine Particulate Matter and Ozone (2012)
](http://publications.gc.ca/pub?id=9.697756&sl=0)
published by the [Canadian Council of Ministers of the
Environment](http://www.ccme.ca).~~

**R package and code:** We have developed an
[**R**](http://www.r-project.org) package to facilitate the calculation
of air quality metrics according to the [Canadian Ambient Air Quality
Standards](https://www.ccme.ca/en/air-quality-report#slide-7).
Download the 'rcaaqs' package from
[GitHub](https://github.com/bcgov/rcaaqs). The source code for repeating
the analysis presented on this page is also available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/bcgov/so2-caaqs-analysis).
